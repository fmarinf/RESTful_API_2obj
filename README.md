# RESTful_API_2obj

API development for a consumer goods company, to obtain/communicate sales data from different suppliers.

This API receives a JSON object in a POST call, validates the format of the read objects, cleans the personal information it contains, generates a unique identification and also sends a response to the provider 400 if there is a problem or 200 if everything works good.
